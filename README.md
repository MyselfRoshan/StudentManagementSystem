## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


## TO DO
>- Insert student inside dashboard as well
>- Add search button as well to search and filter student
>- Add User menu after close, minimize and maximize to do crud operation
>- Create two users admin and student
>- User can only view his information
>- Separate admin dashboard into two columms. First column should contain section to add student data instead of adding student from the outside
